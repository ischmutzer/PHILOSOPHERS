memset: This function is used to fill a block of memory with a particular value. It takes a pointer to the starting memory location, the value to be set, and the number of bytes to be set.

printf: A function used for formatted output. It prints data to the standard output stream (usually the console). It allows formatting options to control how the output is displayed.

malloc: Used for dynamic memory allocation. It allocates a block of memory of a specified size and returns a pointer to the beginning of that block.

free: This function deallocates the memory previously allocated by malloc or a related function. It frees up the memory for further use in the program.

write: Used for writing data to a file descriptor. It's commonly used for low-level file I/O operations, such as writing to files or writing to standard output.

usleep: Pauses the program execution for a specified number of microseconds. It's typically used for adding delays in code execution.

gettimeofday: Retrieves the current time of day and timezone information. It's often used for measuring time intervals or for timestamping events.

pthread_create: Creates a new thread in a multi-threaded program. It takes several parameters, including a pointer to a thread identifier, thread attributes, a start routine, and optional arguments.

pthread_detach: Detaches a thread, allowing its resources to be reclaimed automatically by the system when the thread exits. It's typically used to indicate that the main thread will not join with this thread later.

pthread_join: Waits for a thread to terminate. It suspends the execution of the calling thread until the target thread has terminated.

pthread_mutex_init: Initializes a mutex (mutual exclusion) object with the default attributes or with attributes specified by the programmer.

pthread_mutex_destroy: Destroys a mutex object, releasing any resources associated with it.

pthread_mutex_lock: Locks a mutex object, blocking the calling thread if the mutex is already locked by another thread.

pthread_mutex_unlock: Unlocks a previously locked mutex object, allowing other threads to acquire the lock.
